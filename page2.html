	<h2>Music and clothing.</h2>
	<p>BTS is an iconic k-pop band known throught the whole world. BTS, also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band formed in 2010. The band consists of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook, who co-write or co-produce most of their material. If you are interested in fashion, I recomend you to shop for Hanbok (a traditional korean dress).

	<h2>paintings</h2>
	<p>Min Joung-ki’s painting “Embrace,” from 1981. The artist probed the sociocultural history of South Korea, often drawing imagery from kitschy art sold in the streets of Seoul. Another great painting is a self portrait made with water color. My favorite is the couple by the sea saying goodbye.</p>
